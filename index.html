								<p>
									This is Kull a voodoo game character.<br/>
									With this project I challenged myself to create<br/>
									an awesome game character with at little polygons as possible,<br/>
									but still keeping the smooth shading of the toon shader.<br/>
									The final count is 440 polys and the level of detail is still quite pleasing.
